🚀 Just built Ralph Wiggum for Kiro CLI - implementing Geoffrey Huntley's iterative AI development loop technique!

This project lets AI agents work autonomously in continuous loops, learning from their previous iterations. The agent reads its own past work from files and git history, iteratively improving until completion.

💡 Built this with Bun 1.3 and absolutely loved it:
- ⚡ Lightning-fast runtime - startup times are incredible
- 🧪 Built-in test framework (`bun:test`) - no Jest setup needed
- 📦 Native compilation - single executable builds with `bun build --compile`

No configuration overhead, just pure productivity. Bun 1.3 feels like what JavaScript tooling should have been all along.
